------------------
// 28-01-2019
// v0.1.2

// Changes
- Drop support for console window dragging (see notes)
- Drop support for console resizing (see notes)

// Fix
- Fix regression: OutputContent no longer resizes based on text output

// Change Notes
I dropped support for console dragging and resizing. The reason is threefold:
	1. I was never initially going to support this (scope creep).
	2. There is no obvious way (to me) to implement further improvements (like locking the mouse position if min/max drag area/resize has been reached) without using some hacky work-around.
	3. It's "good enough". Resize and drag *work*, they just don't feel polished.
I may or may not remove dragging and resizing altogether in a later version.
