// CHANGELIST dd/mm/yyyy
------------------

------------------
// 28-01-2019
// v0.3.1

// Changes
- Add custom fonts (just a shortcut [references] in the editor rather than going through each UI element)
- Add custom font sizes (same as above, also see notes)
- Change default font from SourceCodePro to UbuntuMono
- Change volume command help text to be less ambiguous when it came to valid input ("0 - 1" changed to "0.0 to 1.0")

// Fix
- Fix reselect on submit
- Fix the InputText object reference breaking sometimes (10/10, see notes)
- Fix ResetPositionButton

// Change Notes
- Custom font sizes: larger font sizes *will* break functionality of the console. If the font is too large and goes out of the area of the text element, the font will not show.
- InputText obj ref was breaking because I was setting it to null instead of InputText.text, which is the value of the text field..
------------------

------------------
// 28-01-2019
// v0.2.6

// Changes
- Rewrite output functionality
- Add user command output just before command return
- Add console option: change prompt symbol
- Add "exit" command, closes console
- Add exit button functionality, also closes console
- Remove parsing region and plans for config parsing (for now)

// Fix
- Fix MaxLines not removing items in the end of the list when max reached
- Fix volume command: no longer able to set value other than 0.0 to 1.0

// Change Notes
- I attempted to fix the ResetPositionButton functionality but I ran out of hours before this push.
- v2.6, 1 major addition (output), 6 minor (4 adds, 2 fixes), figured I should start versioning these based on real numbers.
------------------

------------------
// 28-01-2019
// v0.1.2

// Changes
- Drop support for console window dragging (see notes)
- Drop support for console resizing (see notes)

// Fix
- Fix regression: OutputContent no longer resizes based on text output

// Change Notes
I dropped support for console dragging and resizing. The reason is threefold:
	1. I was never initially going to support this (scope creep).
	2. There is no obvious way (to me) to implement further improvements (like locking the mouse position if min/max drag area/resize has been reached) without using some hacky work-around.
	3. It's "good enough". Resize and drag *work*, they just don't feel polished.
I may or may not remove dragging and resizing altogether in a later version.
