# How to add commands

1. Duplicate "CommandTemplate.cs"
2. Modify the filename and the classname to reflect the command being created
3. Modify the code within. I've added comments that clearly state how to add a command, and looking at the AddCommand function in `TauCon.cs` should give more indication of what is required to register a command
4. As far as code goes, it's going to be unique to every project, which is why I included only the most basic of commands
5. Have fun! If you find a bug or have a cleaner way of doing something hit me up or submit a PR (Please keep in mind this was my first major completed project with C#/Unity, be nice ðŸ˜…)
